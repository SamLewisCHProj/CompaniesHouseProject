Process:
Created project on vscode and pushed to github

I initially started thinking about all the critical functionality
Identified areas to focus on - front page, admin page, booking system etc 
Created test cases that should be covered
Started writing automated tests
Refactored common code into a common file to reference in other tests
Created a Page object for the front page/admin pages to have selectors available without having to find them every time


Thoughts:

- It would be nice to have these functional tests run in a pipeline on every PR raised by a developer working on the site
- Running this on my local server would prevent the cross contamination of data from other candidates
- If running in a pipeline, I would store the usernames and passwords in the environment variables for that project, as we are not, I have stored them in the tests. I would advocate against this.
