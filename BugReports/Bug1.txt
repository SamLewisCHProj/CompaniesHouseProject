    Front page field validation is not showing which fields are incorrect.

Description:
    There are no useful indicators on the error messages for the site (With the exception of the firstname/lastname fields). For example, when a user tries to book a room on the front page. We should be showing the user information that can help them identify and correct data if there is a problem.

Steps to reproduce:
    - Select a 'Book this room' button for the room you wish to book and click
    - click on 'Book' without filling in any other information

Expected Result:
    User is presented with helpful tooltips to indicate which fields are missing/which rules are not met

Actual Result: 
    User is met with all the tooltips but no information on which fields they apply to.

Other information: 
    {Any other key information to the task}
