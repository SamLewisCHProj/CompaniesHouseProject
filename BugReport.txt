Invalid room number on API is accepted. - using a room that does not exist allows the api to make a booking. It should return a 400, but get a 201.
(See Negative API test - Use invalid room number)

Phone can be a string on api and front end - using all other correct info, a booking can be made when the phone number is a string of text, or any other symbols. Only thing being enforced is the length. (See Negative API test - Use invalid phone number)

Testing the API i noticed the error handling was not complete, just returning bad request on date being incorrect. This could be changed to tell the user which part was incorrectly entered. (Unsure if the api is used to make bookings.)

Recieving 409 errors where i was expdecting to recieve 400's, I would speak with the developer of the site to see if this was the intended behaviour. Encountered the issue during a few of my API tests that use invalid data.


Example bug:

23/01/2025, Identified in V.XX (Could be tags for team members/version/environment etc)
automationtesting.online (any env variables here)
Front page field validation is not showing which fields are incorrect.

Description:
There are no useful indicators on the error messages for the site (With the exception of the firstname/lastname fields). For example, when a user tries to book a room on the front page. We should be showing the user information that can help them identify and correct data if there is a problem.

Steps to reproduce:
    - Select a 'Book this room' button for the room you wish to book and click
    - click on 'Book' without filling in any other information

Expected Result:
    User is presented with helpful tooltips to indicate which fields are missing/which rules are not met

Actual Result: 
    User is met with all the tooltips but no information on which fields they apply to.
